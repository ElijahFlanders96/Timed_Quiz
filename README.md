# Timed_Quiz

Description: 

This quiz is designed to test your knowledge of Apex Legends. Once the user starts the game, they will have 60 seconds to answer 5 multiple choice questions about the game. A user's score for the game is determined by the amount of time left on the clock after the final question is answered, and for every wrong answer, the user will have 5 seconds deducted off the clock. After the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their initials to save their score, and is redirected to a highscores page that displays the scores in order from highest to lowest, alongisde that user's initials. From that page, they can go back to the start of the quiz to try again, or clear the highscores list and start from scratch.
